# Terms & Conditions

These terms govern the consulting and software services provided by Aesir Tecnologia ("Aesir", "we", "us") to the client ("you"). Engaging our services indicates acceptance of this agreement.

## Scope and Deliverables
Project scope, milestones, and deliverables are defined in written proposals or statements of work. Any changes require mutual approval and may affect pricing or timelines. We will notify you promptly about risks that could impact delivery.

## Collaboration Responsibilities
You agree to provide timely access to stakeholders, subject matter experts, assets, or infrastructure required for the project. Delays in access or approvals may extend delivery timelines. We will coordinate with a primary contact to streamline decision making and feedback.

## Fees and Payment
Pricing, invoicing frequency, and payment terms are outlined in the governing proposal or contract. Unless stated otherwise, invoices are due within 15 days of issuance. Late payments may pause work or incur finance charges as allowed by law.

## Intellectual Property
Upon full payment, and unless a different arrangement is documented, ownership of bespoke software or assets created for the project transfers to you. Aesir retains rights to underlying tools, libraries, and methodologies used to build the deliverables and may reuse general learnings in future engagements.

## Confidentiality
Both parties agree to protect confidential or proprietary information shared during the engagement. Each party will use reasonable safeguards, share information only with personnel who need access, and notify the other party of any unauthorized disclosure.

## Warranties and Disclaimers
We deliver services with professional skill and care but cannot guarantee specific business outcomes. Except as stated in the governing contract, the services are provided "as is" without warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.

## Liability
To the extent permitted by law, each party's aggregate liability under this agreement is limited to the fees paid or payable for the services giving rise to the claim. Neither party is liable for indirect, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages.

## Termination
Either party may terminate the engagement for convenience with reasonable written notice or immediately if the other party materially breaches the agreement and fails to cure within 10 days after notice. You are responsible for paying for services delivered up to the termination date.

## Governing Law
Unless otherwise specified in a written agreement, these terms are governed by the laws of Brazil, without regard to conflict-of-law provisions. Disputes will be handled in the courts of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil.
