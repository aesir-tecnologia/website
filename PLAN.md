## ü§ñ Implementation Prompt for Claude Code

**Prompt**: Please systematically implement this comprehensive website update plan using specialized subagents for optimal execution. Use the Task tool to launch multiple agents in parallel whenever possible to maximize efficiency.

### Execution Strategy

**Phase 1: Foundation Setup**
- Launch `general-purpose` agent to analyze current codebase structure and patterns
- Launch `general-purpose` agent to parse and organize content from docs/COPY-EN.md and docs/COPY-PT_BR.md
- Launch `general-purpose` agent to audit existing translation files (messages/en.json, messages/pt.json)

**Validation Gate 1 - Foundation Validation**
- Launch `general-purpose` agent for code review of foundation analysis
- Launch `general-purpose` agent to verify adherence to project specifications from CLAUDE.md
- Launch `general-purpose` agent using Playwright MCP to test current site functionality baseline

**Phase 2: Content Implementation** 
- Launch `general-purpose` agent for Homepage Updates (Section 1)
- Launch `general-purpose` agent for Services Section creation (Section 2) 
- Launch `general-purpose` agent for Navigation Updates (Section 3)
- Launch `general-purpose` agent for Translation Files updates (Section 4)

**Validation Gate 2 - Content Implementation Validation**
- Launch `general-purpose` agent for comprehensive code review of all content changes
- Launch `general-purpose` agent to verify specification adherence for homepage and services
- Launch `general-purpose` agent using Playwright MCP to test homepage, services pages, and navigation in both EN/PT locales

**Phase 3: Page Refinements**
- Launch `general-purpose` agent for About Page Updates (Section 5)
- Launch `general-purpose` agent for Contact Page Updates (Section 6) 
- Launch `general-purpose` agent for Work/Portfolio Page updates (Section 7)

**Validation Gate 3 - Page Refinements Validation**
- Launch `general-purpose` agent for code review of About, Contact, and Work page changes
- Launch `general-purpose` agent to verify specification adherence for updated pages
- Launch `general-purpose` agent using Playwright MCP to test About, Contact, and Work pages functionality and forms

**Phase 4: Component Development**
- Launch `general-purpose` agent for Component Updates (Section 8)
- Launch `general-purpose` agent for Footer Updates (Section 9)

**Validation Gate 4 - Component Development Validation**
- Launch `general-purpose` agent for code review of new components and footer changes

- Launch `general-purpose` agent using Playwright MCP to test all new components (carousel, service cards, CTAs) across different pages

**Phase 5: Final Quality Assurance**
- Launch `general-purpose` agent for end-to-end testing across all pages in both EN and PT languages
- Launch `general-purpose` agent to verify all links and navigation work correctly
- Launch `general-purpose` agent to validate responsive design across all new pages

**Final Validation Gate - Complete System Validation**
- Launch `general-purpose` agent for comprehensive code review of entire implementation
- Launch `general-purpose` agent to verify complete adherence to all specifications
- Launch `general-purpose` agent using Playwright MCP for full end-to-end testing of entire website functionality, forms, navigation, and responsive behavior

### Agent Task Distribution Guidelines

**Implementation Agents** should:
1. **Reference Documentation**: Always consult docs/COPY-EN.md and docs/COPY-PT_BR.md for exact copy
2. **Follow Project Conventions**: Adhere to patterns established in CLAUDE.md
3. **Maintain Internationalization**: Ensure all changes support both EN and PT locales
4. **Use Existing Components**: Leverage current component library before creating new ones
5. **Verify Implementation**: Test changes in development environment before completion

**Validation Gate Agents** must perform:
1. **Code Review**: 
   - Check code quality, patterns, and adherence to project conventions
   - Verify proper internationalization implementation
   - Review component structure and reusability
   - Validate proper import statements and file organization
2. **Specification Adherence**:
   - Verify implementation matches docs/COPY-EN.md and docs/COPY-PT_BR.md exactly
   - Check that all required sections from PLAN.md are implemented
   - Confirm proper Next.js App Router patterns are followed
   - Validate Tailwind CSS v4 usage and styling patterns
3. **Browser Testing with Playwright MCP**:
   - Test functionality in both EN and PT locales
   - Verify responsive design across different screen sizes
   - Test all interactive elements (forms, navigation, CTAs)
   - Validate animations and transitions work properly
   - Check for console errors or accessibility issues

### Execution Command

Run agents in parallel using single message with multiple Task tool calls:
```
Launch all Phase 1 agents simultaneously, then proceed through phases systematically, running agents in parallel within each phase for maximum efficiency.
```

This approach ensures systematic implementation while maintaining code quality and project conventions throughout the transformation process.
