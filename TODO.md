## Evidence & Follow-ups

### 2. Discovery & Inventory ‚Äî complete
- `docs/discovery.md:1-74` now documents the shared component/composable system across routes.
- Action: Keep the inventory synced as new sections or data sources are introduced.

### 3. Nuxt UI Foundation & Theming ‚Äî complete
- `app/app.config.ts:1-109` now stores surfaces, borders, text, accent tokens, and app-shell gradients under `ui.tokens`.
- `app/components/layout/AppShell.vue:1-61` renders backgrounds directly from those tokens; `app/assets/css/main.css:1-28` is reduced to Tailwind/Nuxt UI imports plus the base reset.
- Action: Consider extracting additional Nuxt UI variant presets if future work needs bespoke component theming.

### 4. Layout Shell & Global UI ‚Äî done, with enhancement in backlog
- App shell and layout components ship (`app/app.vue:1-9`, `app/components/layout/AppShell.vue:1-20`).
- Header delivers color mode toggle + mobile slide-over (`app/components/layout/AppHeader.vue:1-133`); however, responsive behavior still relies on Tailwind breakpoints rather than `@nuxtjs/device` heuristics noted in the plan.
- Action: Decide whether device detection is still needed; if so, integrate `useDevice()` to manage mobile menu state.

### 5. Shared Component System ‚Äî complete
- Structural primitives live under `app/components/shared/` (e.g., `BaseSection.vue:1-73`, `SectionHeader.vue`, `ContentGrid.vue`).
- Marketing modules align with plan (`app/components/modules/HeroSection.vue:1-140`, `ProcessTimeline.vue`, `TechnologyMarquee.vue:1-145`).
- Utility atoms exist (`app/components/ui/AppButton.vue:1-69`, `BackgroundVariant.vue`, `IconBadge.vue`). Docs mirror implementation (`docs/components/STRUCTURAL.md:1-90`, `docs/components/MODULES.md:1-120`, `docs/components/UTILITIES.md:1-120`). No follow-up required.

### 6. Forms & Interactive Elements ‚Äî shipped with mocked backend
- Contact form now wraps Nuxt UI controls (`app/components/modules/ContactCard.vue:1-160`), driven by `useContactForm` validation/submission (`app/composables/useContactForm.ts:1-112`).
- Documentation captured in `docs/components/FORMS.md:1-90`.
- Action: Replace simulated delay with real submission when API is available; consider adopting zod-based schema as originally scoped.

### 7. Composables & Data Access ‚Äî content centralised, helpers missing
- Primary content composables exist (`app/composables/useHomepageContent.ts:1-6`, `useServicesContent.ts:1-22`, `useAboutContent.ts:1-6`), backed by typed data modules in `app/data/content/`.
- `useSiteSocialLinks` remains a stub (`app/composables/useSiteSocialLinks.ts:1-8`), and planned helpers like `useSectionCopy` / `useTechnologyStack` were not created (`app/composables/` listing lacks them).
- Action: Implement the remaining helpers so future sections and tech marquees pull from shared sources rather than ad-hoc mappings in data files.

### 8. Page Migration Plan ‚Äî complete
- All marketing routes leverage shared modules, and legal pages now use `useLegalContent()` + shared sections (`app/pages/privacy.vue:1-72`, `app/pages/terms.vue:1-72`).
- Action: Monitor future routes for deviations from the shared component stack.

### 9. Deferred Backlog ‚Äî untouched (expected)
- i18n resources remain empty (`i18n.config.ts:1-11`), SEO presets rely on page-level `useSeoMeta`, and analytics hooks are absent. This matches the plan‚Äôs deferral; just track for future cycles.

### 10. Quality, Testing & Verification ‚Äî manual only
- QA artefacts recorded (`docs/qa/REPORT.md:1-20`, screenshots under `docs/qa/`).
- Repository still lacks automated tests or tooling (`tests/` directory absent). Plan suggested adding smoke/snapshot tests, so this remains outstanding.
- Action: Stand up Vitest + testing-library suites for critical components or document why the automation is postponed.

### 11. Documentation & Governance ‚Äî partially aligned
- Component usage guides maintained (`docs/components/*.md`).
- Contributor checklist should be reviewed to ensure it mirrors the new tokens/composable workflows.
- Action: Update `docs/CONTRIBUTOR-CHECKLIST.md` if any new guardrails emerge and keep the discovery inventory in sync with future changes.

## Next Suggested Priorities
1. Implement remaining composables (`useSectionCopy`, socials, technology stack) to close out Section 7.
2. Establish automated tests (Vitest or Playwright smoke suite) to make progress on Section 10.
3. Continue backlog grooming for localization/SEO once the shared system stabilises.
